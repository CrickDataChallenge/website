## Our next event is 11-13th October 2023

Crick Data Challenge #6 will take place on 11-13th October 2023, in person at the Francis Crick Institute, London.

[Get in touch](mailto:challenge-data@crick.ac.uk) if you would like to ask any questions about the event or would like to discuss ideas for projects. 

- Registration for Crick scientists is [available on the Crick intranet](https://intranet.crick.ac.uk/webform/crick-data-challenge-sign-form-2023) (Crick IT account required). External participants can register their interest to participate at [this link](https://forms.office.com/r/CHFWM2FB1q).


#### How does it work?

1. Crick scientists submit their projects to the data challenge. 
2. The organising committee selects up to 5 hackathon-ready projects. 
3. Data scientists (internal and external) sign up to the event. They're given a clue about the theme of each project, but no spoilers. 
4. On day 1, project leaders introduce their problem and take questions from participants, after which participants form teams. 
5. Teams go to their private space to collaborate and hack away! Every day ends with a social activity. 
6. On day 3, each group gives a short wrap-up presentation on their approach to solving the problem and what they learned.

The video below will give you a glimpse of what the Crick Data Challenge is about!

<!-- In the run up to the event in October, Crick scientists are encouraged to submit projects to us, and five projects are selected from a range of different Crick research groups.  -->

Examples of previous projects include:

* Integration of multiomic datasets to identify biomarkers for non-invasive, early detection of cancer. 
* Creation of a program with a user interface to design antisense oligonucleotides. 
* Integration of huge amounts of cancer RNA-Seq data to identify genes that could be therapeutic targets. 
* Design of a method to categorise and classify spherical cell images from a magnetic tweezer microscope system. 
* Investigation of Drosophila fruit preferences using chemical, behavioural and electrophysiological data sets. 
* Implementation of a streamlined pipeline for analysing highly complex, multi-dimensional imaging data.

Many more projects have seeded ongoing collaborations and we expect to see more publications in the future!

### Thoughts from previous participants...
 
**_Lucia Prieto-Godino, Group leader_**

>“The Crick Data Challenge is a great initiative; as soon as I heard about it I decided to join and encouraged my students to do so. We are lucky to work in such a multidisciplinary environment at the crick. Each discipline has classical ways to analyse data and we often do not go beyond these. However, by looking at our data from a different perspective we might gain novel biological insights.”

**_Febe van Maldegem, Downward lab_**

>“I can’t thank my team enough for all the effort they put into working on our project. It’s unbelievable how much we achieved in just two days. Now we can start focusing on the results, rather than the data processing.”

**_Ana Solaguren-Beascoa, Benevolent AI_**

>“Collaborating with people from the Crick was a great experience – I was so impressed by the quality of all the projects. As someone with no-biomed education, I even had a difficult time deciding which project I actually wanted to help with! I was surprised by the amount of input people from industry could contribute. For the first time since I left academia, I had the total feeling I could contribute to scientific projects outside of my expertise area, by using the technical skills I've learned in industry. I would definitely take part again!”

**_Omar El Oakley, Beale Lab - Crick Data Challenge 2021_**

>“An excellent experience! Everyone in the team was incredibly engaged and had so many creative ideas and questions - the analysis that we put together ended up giving me a whole set of new directions to pursue my research.”

**_Elé​onore Schneegans, Imperial College London - Crick Data Challenge 2022_**

>“I thought [the Data Challenge] was going to be a perfect opportunity to apply the skills that I work with on a day to day basis to another challenge. [Sofia] pitched her project first, and immediately I figured out that it was going to be useful for me to work on this data integration. I hope we'll keep this collaboration going!”

**_Christoph Messner & Matt White, Ralser Lab_**

>“For us, it was great to see how team members approached our problem from different angles and brought up ideas that we would have never thought of. It really is remarkable how much our team achieved within 2 days! The data challenge showed us the great collaborative atmosphere we have within the Crick, especially as we continue to work with our team beyond the challenge. Beside all of the scientific achievements, we had a great time and lot of fun, even though we only met most of the team members virtually.”

**_Laabiah Wasim, Tolar lab_**

>“As a wet-lab biologist, the Crick Data Challenge provided a unique opportunity to investigate an explorative question I had, but didn’t have the bioinformatics/machine-learning skills to answer. I got to work with such brilliant individuals and going back and forth with the idea as a team accelerated its development into a project we’re hoping to continue working on. It all depends on assembling the right team of individuals, which the Crick Data Challenge provided the perfect place for!”
