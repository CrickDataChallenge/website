## Our next event is the 6-8th October 2021

Crick Data Challenge #4 will be coming your way at the beginning of October, so [put the date in your diary!](http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20211006T090000Z%2F20211008T173000Z&text=Crick%20Data%20Challenge&location=Francis%20Crick%20Institute&details=Hackathon-style%20event%20fostering%20collaborations%20between%20wet%20lab%20biologists%20and%20data%20scientists.%20Hosted%20at%20the%20Francis%20Crick%20Institute.)  (exact times TBC) {% octicon calendar %}

Sign up for externals will open soon, and registration for Crick scientists is available [on the intranet](https://intranet.crick.ac.uk/webform/crick-data-challenge-sign-form) (Crick staff only).

#### Confirmed events

* *Github tutorial with Mickael Escudero (28th September at 2pm)* - Learn how to manage your Data Challenge project with Github!

* *Keynote lecture* - Friday 8th October - Keynote lecture from a leading data scientist (details to follow soon!)

#### How does this all work?

In the run up to the 6th of October Crick scientists were encouraged to submit projects to us (we now have our full quota for October, but please [get in touch](mailto:challenge-data@crick.ac.uk) if you have ideas for projects at future events!). 

Examples of previously successful projects include:
* Creation of a program with a user interface to design antisense oligonucleotides.
* Integration of huge amounts of cancer RNA-Seq data in order to identify genes that could be therapeutic targets.
* Design of a method to categorise and classify spherical cell images from a magnetic tweezer microscope system.
* Investigation of Drosophila fruit preferences using chemical, behavioural and electrophysiological data sets.
* Implementation of a streamlined pipeline for analysing highly complex, multi-dimensional imaging data.

Work from previous data challenges has even been published, for example [this](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-301541/v1) from Febe van Maldegem and [this](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.645446/full) from Katalin Wilkinson, project leaders from the first and second data challenges respectively. Many more projects have seeded ongoing collaborations and we expect to see more publications in the future!

Four projects have been selected for DC4, broad overviews will be shared with registered participants before the event. At the beginning of the event, project leads will pitch their projects to the participants on Wednesday October 6th. Participants then have a chance to think about which team you want to join. That afternoon, participants will form teams and work until Friday on the project. On Friday afternoon, each group will present a short presentation about what they have achieved/learnt!

For more information about how the event works, please check out our introductory slides from [Data Challenge #2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ey5_b0nZZoQQO_7Mdljbz7ckRt1TbFOYxzhY6hWwFMc/edit?usp=sharing).

If you have any questions at all, please email [challenge-data@crick.ac.uk](mailto:challenge-data@crick.ac.uk) and we will get back to you.

All attendees at our events must adhere to our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Thoughts from previous participants...
 

**_Lucia Prieto-Godino, Group leader_**

>“The Crick Data Challenge is a great initiative; as soon as I heard about it I decided to join and encouraged my students to do so. We are lucky to work in such a multidisciplinary environment at the crick. Each discipline has classical ways to analyse data and we often do not go beyond these. However, by looking at our data from a different perspective we might gain novel biological insights.”

**_Febe van Maldegem, Downward lab_**

>"I can’t thank my team enough for all the effort they put into working on our project. It’s unbelievable how much we achieved in just two days. Now we can start focusing on the results, rather than the data processing.”
