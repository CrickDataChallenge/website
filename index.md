## Our next event is 12-14th October 2022

Crick Data Challenge #5 will be coming your way on 12-14th October 2022, happening in person at the Francis Crick Institute.

Registration for Crick scientists is [available on the Crick intranet](https://intranet.crick.ac.uk/webform/crick-data-challenge-2022) (Crick IT account required). External participants can register their interest to participate at [this link](https://forms.office.com/r/CHFWM2FB1q).


#### How does this all work?

In the run up to the event in October, Crick scientists are encouraged to submit projects to us (deadline end of August), please [get in touch](mailto:challenge-data@crick.ac.uk) if you have ideas for projects at this or future events. 

Examples of previously successful projects include:
* Creation of a program with a user interface to design antisense oligonucleotides.
* Integration of huge amounts of cancer RNA-Seq data in order to identify genes that could be therapeutic targets.
* Design of a method to categorise and classify spherical cell images from a magnetic tweezer microscope system.
* Investigation of Drosophila fruit preferences using chemical, behavioural and electrophysiological data sets.
* Implementation of a streamlined pipeline for analysing highly complex, multi-dimensional imaging data.

Work from previous data challenges has been published, for example 
* [Characterisation of tumour immune microenvironment remodelling following oncogene inhibition in preclinical studies using an optimised imaging mass cytometry workflow](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-301541/v1) from Febe van Maldegem and Karishma Valand's project in the first Data Challenge. 
* [Antiretroviral Treatment-Induced Decrease in Immune Activation Contributes to Reduced Susceptibility to Tuberculosis in HIV-1/Mtb Co-infected Persons](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.645446/full) from Katalin Wilkinson's project in the second Data Challenge.
* [OxoScan-MS: Oxonium ion scanning mass spectrometry facilitates plasma glycoproteomics in large scale](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.01.494393v1) from Matthew White and Christoph Messner's project in the third Data Challenge.

Many more projects have seeded ongoing collaborations and we expect to see more publications in the future!

Broad overviews of each project will be shared with registered participants shortly before the event. At the beginning of the event on Wednesday October 12th, project leads will pitch their projects to the participants. Participants will then have a chance to discuss with all the project leaders to help choose which team they want to join. That afternoon, participants will form teams and work until Friday on the project. On Friday afternoon, each group will present a short overview about what they have achieved/learned!

For more information about how the event works, please check out our introductory slides from [Data Challenge #2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ey5_b0nZZoQQO_7Mdljbz7ckRt1TbFOYxzhY6hWwFMc/edit?usp=sharing).

If you have any questions at all, please email [challenge-data@crick.ac.uk](mailto:challenge-data@crick.ac.uk) and we will get back to you.

All attendees at our events must adhere to our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Thoughts from previous participants...
 

**_Lucia Prieto-Godino, Group leader_**

>“The Crick Data Challenge is a great initiative; as soon as I heard about it I decided to join and encouraged my students to do so. We are lucky to work in such a multidisciplinary environment at the crick. Each discipline has classical ways to analyse data and we often do not go beyond these. However, by looking at our data from a different perspective we might gain novel biological insights.”

**_Febe van Maldegem, Downward lab_**

>"I can’t thank my team enough for all the effort they put into working on our project. It’s unbelievable how much we achieved in just two days. Now we can start focusing on the results, rather than the data processing.”
